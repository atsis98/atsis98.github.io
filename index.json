As a final year Mechanical Engineering student at BPHC, I had to dedicate a semester to pursue either the Practice School II program or switch to a thesis. Cultivating an inclination towards the world of research through my second and third year of college, I decided that it would benefit my future if I pursued a thesis and got a taste of how life in the world of academia would be.\nI’ve had an affinity for outer space and flying objects since childhood, and I aimed to convert that into a tangible career path during the course of my undergraduate studies. From taking up courses, both online and on-campus to further my understanding to being a part of various technical teams, I attempted to mould my profile to become proficient with fluid mechanics and dynamics. Hoping to work in Aerodynamics or Computational Fluid Dynamics, I started looking up about various professors at prestigious institutions across the globe who worked in these fields, going by their research impact and the research output of the universities they worked in. After creating a shortlist, I started sending out mails in January 2019, which was rather late in hindsight. I mailed around 170 professors, out of which I received around 30 rejections. Towards the end of February, I finally got an acceptance from Prof. Luigi Vigevano at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, Politecnico di Milano (Polimi). I was elated at the prospect of going to an institute ranked #7 by QS in the field of Aerospace Engineering, and began the formalities of the PS to Thesis conversion and my Visa Application.\nNever having been out of the country – going to Milan promised to be an eye-opening experience. In addition to hosting one of the premier research institutes in the world, Milan is also a cultural epicentre, which appealed to my interests. August is the summer month in Italy, during which most colleges have holidays. Polimi was scheduled to remain shut for an entire week, so I planned a small trip across the beautiful land of Italy at that time. Hopping from Rome to Venice, while visiting Florence, Pisa and the coastal Villages of Cinque Terre, the week-long trip provided memories for a lifetime. In addition, Milan houses the San Siro, the shared football stadium of AC Milan and Internazionale, and is home to the Monza Formula 1 track as well. Being an avid fan of both sports, I attended three Champions League matches and the 2019 Italian Grand Prix at Monza, fulfilling a lifelong dream of being present at a live sporting event. Even if you disregard these high-profile sporting attractions, Milan as a city can be described as a crossroad where the classics and the modern meet. It is truly a wonderfully vibrant city, ensuring that the time I got off my thesis was well spent exploring the city on foot and through the immaculate public transportation system.\n Attending the 2019 Italian Grand Prix at Monza   I worked at Polimi from mid-July to the end of December, a duration of 5 and a half months. My work involved running simulations on their in-house software called ROSITA and investigating the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic features of rotating helicopter blades. I worked directly with Prof. Vigevano, with Jinbin Fu, a PhD student, occasionally helping me out. Although I knew the principles of aerodynamics, aeroacoustics was a new field for me, and operating the Linux terminal to tweak the software and run simulations taught me a lot. It took a bit of time to get used to the new environment and the task expected of me, with most of July and August going in familiarizing myself with the software and the concepts required for me to run the simulations. Prof. Vigevano was immensely helpful in this process, and once I was confident enough, the simulations and analysis of results were familiar territories.\n The Rotorcraft Aerodynamic Laboratory   In terms of funding, I could not receive any funding from BITS. After consultations with Prof. Vigevano, it was decided that I would not be required to pay any fee to Polimi, although there would be no funds to support my stay in Milan. While this seemed a costly endeavour, I believe it was worth every rupee, for the enormity of the opportunity and the plethora of avenues it opened for me.\n Prof. Vigevano and me   Many people ask me about the benefit of doing an off-campus thesis abroad. I would say that it boils down to two parameters: international research exposure and an opportunity to make an informed decision about your future. The research environment is very different abroad, as compared to India. While our curriculum focuses on bookish learning with provisions to gain hands-on experience, learning among peers and meaningful academic interactions with Professors are two things which I feel are underrepresented in the Indian College Education system. While BITS follows a modern approach with a flexible curriculum and a competent peer group, I feel that the system is open enough to incorporate both of the above aspects to help us learn better. Apart from that, the facilities I found at Polimi were cutting-edge in most respects, providing a perfect base for academic research to take flight. Regarding my point about making an informed decision, the thesis gave me a glimpse into my future, teaching me the appropriate research methodology and the avenues to be explored in academia. This experience converted my initial feeling of going for masters and ultimately, a PhD into a clearer idea of pursuing a PhD in a subfield of Aerodynamics. This process of gaining clarity is crucial in deciding your academic future, as a hasty decision at this juncture might lead to unfavourable consequences.\nAnother question I get a lot is the importance of CGPA while applying for a thesis and the importance given to your profile apart from the all-important number. In my experience, both personal and anecdotal, I have observed that you will have a higher chance of getting accepted if you have previous research experience in the field you are applying to. In general, having a low CGPA requires you to have something that offsets and explains it. In my case, it was my projects and my involvement in the technical teams, but there is no set rubric for the same. All I can say is that you can never be sure of what a Professor is looking for, so strive to be the best version of yourself and don’t estimate the worth of your profile based only on your CGPA.\n","date":1597939476,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597939476,"objectID":"dc97825023325cf043ce95b8ed19d50a","permalink":"https://atsis98.github.io/post/milan-thesis-tales/","publishdate":"2020-08-20T21:34:36+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/milan-thesis-tales/","section":"post","summary":"This is an article I wrote at the behest of the Journal Club at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, about my thesis at Polimi","tags":["Aerodynamics","Rotorcraft Dynamics","CFD"],"title":"The Italian Job","type":"post"},{"authors":["Harsha Sista"],"categories":["Undergraduate Projects"],"content":"The project aims to introduce a new design of an instrument that combines the functionality of surgical forceps, a Suction-Irrigation (S-I) device, and a Carbon Dioxide (CO2) insufflator. To understand the project in the right context, I will start with a brief introduction to surgery and laparoscopy before moving on to the details of the project.\nIntroduction The abdominal cavity has long been a focus for surgical procedures since it contains a variety of organs and is relatively easy to access from the outside. However, surgeons traditionally made a cut that was 6-12 inches long to see the organ they were working on and give enough room for the proper maneuvers. However, the onset of laparoscopy changed this completely. Laparoscopy is a minimally-invasive diagnostic procedure used by surgeons to examine and operate upon organs in the abdomen. Several small cuts are made, usually less than half an inch wide, through which a camera and the surgical instruments are inserted. This advantages of doing so are listed below:\n There is minimal scarring since the size of the cuts is smaller Lesser possibility of hemorrhaging, leading to the lesser necessity of blood transfusions Lesser pain for the patient Faster recovery time, leading to quicker normalization back into society  Due to these advantages, laparoscopy has quickly gained traction among the medical community as a viable alternative to opening up the abdominal cavity.\n Figure 1: An example of laparoscopy   How is Laparoscopic Surgery performed? In laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon views the abdominal cavity from the monitor and operates by creating multiple incisions and inserting trocars of 5-12 mm sizes, as shown in the figure below. A trocar is a surgical instrument that is sharp-pointed and is used with the cannula to puncture the abdominal cavity and to insert different instruments through it.\n Figure 2: An overview of the instruments used in a laparoscopic surgery   Initially, the surgeon makes a small incision through a trocar near the belly button. Then a camera-enabled laparoscope is inserted into the abdominal cavity through a trocar into the first of the three ports. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas (a method known as pneumoperitoneum) through the second port to view internal organs clearly on a monitor. The reason for preferring carbon dioxide over other gases is that it is non-flammable, non-combustible, colorless, readily soluble in water, cheap, and reduces the risk of complications occurring by blood clots in veins.\nThe final port is for the laparoscopic forceps, to perform operations such as grasping, cutting, lasing, cauterizing, etc. After inflating the carbon dioxide gas, the surgeon inserts the required instruments and begins operating.\nWhat is being done in the project? The objectives of the project are enumerated below:\n To design and develop a laparoscopic surgical device which:  Functions as a multipurpose and reusable instrument that can cut, grasp, and cauterize the tissue. Is useful for simultaneous suction and irrigation and Carbon dioxide insufflation. Provides added safety by avoiding multiple insertion and removal, reducing the time of surgery. Can be assembled and disassembled with ease, facilitating fast sterilization.   To simulate the flow of blood through the annular region in ANSYS Fluent using the various models of non-newtonian flow. To simulate the multiphase flow of carbon dioxide and water for various volume fractions.  Part 1: Designing the novel instrument I joined the ongoing project in January 2020, with the initial objective of running simulations, but with my previous experience with design and Solidworks in particular, I started on converting the conceptual idea into a tangible design. The idea was simple, modify and add on to an existing design of the forceps, as shown in the figure below:\n Figure 3: Existing surgical forceps   To achieve the desired multi-functionality, we decided to add a sleeve covering the forceps, which would act as the common conduit for the S-I process as well as the CO2 insufflation, depending on usage.\nAfter spending the first few weeks building a forceps assembly based on existing designs, I added the outer sleeve and other components as required. The design process was iterative in nature, with me working closely with my two advising professors and the Ph.D. student to give it the desired shape, literally and figuratively. After all the requirements were met, we filed an Invention Disclosure Form and applied for an Indian Patent for our design.\nPart 2: Non-Newtonian Simulations What is a non-Newtonian fluid? It is a fluid that does not follow Newton\u0026rsquo;s law of viscosity. Now, what is that? Newton defines viscosity as the ratio between shear stress and shear rate.\n In Newtonian fluids, the viscosity remains constant and is independent of stress. In non-Newtonian fluids, viscosity can change when under force to either more liquid or more solid, so they can become thicker or thinner under force. An example of this is ketchup becoming runnier when shaken (and possibly even stirred).\nBlood is one such non-newtonian fluid. Since laparoscopic surgery involves grasping tissue using forceps and using the S-I apparatus to suck out the excess fluids, blood is the obvious choice for the fluid to simulate for our instrument.\nThere are many models available to model blood as a non-newtonian fluid in ANSYS, a simulation software. We chose to go with two such models and run simulations to decide which gave better results.\nOnce the outer sleeve was added onto the design, I extracted a fluid domain from it, which would serve as the geometry for all the fluid simulations we were going to do. Importing it into ANSYS, we spent a couple of weeks conducting mesh-independent studies to select one final mesh.\nThen, with the two models and the final mesh, we simulated the process of the apparatus sucking the blood out of the operating area, by giving the appropriate pressure differences. The resulting depictions of the flow physics were interesting, to say the least, and make up the crux of a couple of research papers that are being written right now.\nPart 3: Multiphase Simulations The part I am currently working on, apart from writing a few papers detailing our research, is multiphase simulations. So what exactly does multiphase flow mean? It refers to the flow of two or more fluid phases through the same medium. In this case, for CO2 insufflation, CO2 and air make up the two phases that flow through the outer sleeve. Therefore, the modeling of this situation on ANSYS is much more complex. To reduce a degree of complexity, the inlet was divided into two fractions, according to the respective volume fraction of the two elements, and then simulated in Fluent. These are very computationally intensive simulations, which in ordinary speak means that they take a lot of time. For the next month or so, I will be working on this. Stay tuned for further updates, and you just might be rewarded with more details for your patience.\nConclusion I have been working on this project since the beginning of the year. Although this is a new area of research, having never ventured to the biomechanical side of my degree, it caught my interest in my initial conversations with Prof. Murthy when I approached him for a project back in November last year. Although most of my research work has been related to topics that come under the banner of Aerospace Engineering, I am glad I took up a topic that was on a different segment of the broad Mechanical umbrella. In addition to giving me insights into the design and simulation of a practical problem, this project honed my research methodology, especially with respect to the iterative nature of the process and the hard work involved in sowing the seeds that will eventually blossom into tangible branches of knowledge.\nI am deeply grateful to have the opportunity to have worked for an extended period of time on this project, and I believe that my skillset is much improved because of this. Carrying this forward, I shall complete the rest of my tenure with the same enthusiasm for learning with which I began this journey.\n","date":1597770488,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597770488,"objectID":"6500b90dc97bf0f6f0b992a29ab3b538","permalink":"https://atsis98.github.io/project/laparoscopy/","publishdate":"2020-08-18T22:38:08+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/laparoscopy/","section":"project","summary":"The project aims to introduce a new design of an instrument that combines the functionality of surgical forceps, a Suction-Irrigation (S-I) device, and a Carbon Dioxide (CO2) insufflator.

In this thesis, the aerodynamic study of the flow field around the tail rotor and fuselage of a rotorcraft is conducted by generating a high-resolution grid using ANSYS ICEM. Subsequent simulations are carried out on the in-house CFD solver, ROSITA, using the Navier-Stokes governing equation in combination with the Spallart-Allmaras Turbulence Model.\nIntroduction Aerodynamics has always been at the cutting edge with respect to the development of aircraft and rotorcraft. With the development of computational methods and the resource to put them to use, aerodynamics has grown into something bigger and better. With today’s technology and tools, it is possible to analyze the flow past a stationary wing or a moving rotor and improve the design according to the requirements accordingly. Consequently, a lot of research has focused on this sector of the aerospace industry. With rotorcraft being more inherently complex aeromechanical vehicles, the understanding of the development of the flow field around them has lagged behind the traditional fixed-wing planes. Studying how the flow interacts and the noise it generates is garnering more attention as people are looking to increase the efficiency of future machines in terms of performance, as well as the generated sound. Therefore, gaining an understanding of noise generation and its relation to the aerodynamics of rotorcraft is of the utmost importance.\nContext of the present work The scientific work undertaken during the course of this project is in the context of the work done by the European Action Group AG 24, ‘Helicopter Fuselage Scattering Effects for Exterior/Interior Noise Reduction’ in the Group for Aeronautical Research and Technology in Europe (GARTEUR). The objectives of this AG are:\n To develop and validate numerical prediction methods To generate a unique noise scattering database through wind tunnel tests using generic configurations.  Objectives The objectives of my thesis were:\n Grid generation around the tail rotor and the fuselage used by the Group for Aeronautical Research and Technology in Europe (GARTEUR) for the study of scattering by the helicopter fuselage. Usage of the in-house solver, Rotorcraft Solver Italy (ROSITA), to run aerodynamic simulations on the isolated tail rotor. Understanding the basics of aeroacoustics. Running the simulation on the Rotor plus Fuselage Configuration on ROSITA.  An insight into Noise Noise can be generated from rotorcraft from a variety of sources, out of which the rotor, the engine, and the transmission, are the major sources. In the previous two decades, noise reduction has received industrial attention due to certification rules becoming more stringent. Due to industrial involvement, the development of prediction codes has taken a turn for the better. To meet the needs of the industry, the research into noise reduction has really taken off.\nNoise is broadly classified into three categories, as shown in Figure 1:\n loading and broadband noise blade-vortex noise thickness and high-speed impulsive noise   Figure 1: Different kinds of noise generated by a Helicopter Rotor.   A helicopter rotor is essentially an unsteady mechanism due to the velocity difference between the advancing and retreating sides. As shown in Figure 2, this creates different kinds of impacts and wakes, leading to noise generation.\n Figure 2: A schematic of the aeromechanical environment of a helicopter rotor.   Prediction codes are used to simulate the noise generated by helicopters and are divided into the following two categories:\n Computational Aeroacoustics Approach (CAA) Approach based on Integral formulation  While CAA permits a combined aerodynamic and aeroacoustic study, it is very computationally intensive, since it is based on the classical field methods. On the other hand, Integral methods have a pre-requisite of the aerodynamic knowledge around the rotor but are more suitable for obtaining aeroacoustic data at any point in the given field. It is in the development of such integral methods that the current research trend has its focus.\nGeometry and meshing The geometry used by AG24 is that of a simple fuselage, with a tail boom and a tail rotor. Since the focus of this project was only on the tail rotor, only the relevant parts were extracted, as shown below:\n Figure 3: Blade and Hub assembly, with part of the drive shaft   For simplification of the simulation process, the hub and the drive shaft of the assembly are neglected during calculations, and the resultant geometry is depicted below:\n Figure 4: Only the Blades   A high-resolution grid around the rotor is required for the computation of the aerodynamics around the specified geometry for achieving a mesh independent simulation. During the solving process, the mesh should also be able to tag onto another background mesh if necessary. Due to the flexibility, it offers during meshing and the variety of options it provides for meshing complex and faceted geometries, ANSYS ICEM has been used as the meshing software.\nSimulation setup ROtorcraft Software ITAly (ROSITA), version V 4.63, is the in-house solver that is used for this simulation during the course of this thesis. Its core element is a multi-block-structured steady, or unsteady solver with a second-order discretization scheme that supports overset grids. It supports the usage of the Chimera method, also known as the overset mesh technique, for meshing the domain. The overset method has multiple meshes with different geometrical complexities and tag them to a single overarching mesh. In this scenario, the surface mesh is tagged to the background mesh.\nThe methodology to be followed for running the simulation is as follows:\n Setting up parameters like the Governing Equations, Turbulence model, and time step in the configuration file, ROSITA.cfg. Assigning the number of processors required for computation. Executing the code and running the post-processor after completion.  ROSITA offers a variety of options for the solution: Solving the Euler equations, solving the Navier-Stokes equations without any turbulence model, and solving the RANS equations with a Spallart-Allmaras (S-A) turbulence model. To make a comparative study, the Blade Rotor simulation was run with two different setups:\n Navier-Stokes equation without turbulence Navier-Stokes equation with Spallart-Allmaras turbulence model.  Result extraction on Tecolot Tecplot is a data visualization and post-processing software that is suitable for working with raw simulation data. Since the ROSITA post-processor outputs files in a Tecplot format, it is the natural choice for analyzing the results of the simulation.\nThe distribution of pressure over the surface of the blade is an interesting phenomenon that calls to be investigated. It is also important from an aeroacoustic point of view since many noise propagation codes, and studies use the pressure field in their calculations. Therefore, obtaining a proper pressure distribution is essential, and a comparison to see which model yields the better results is made.\nThe ROSITA Solver generates two surface files in the .plt format, with data for each of the two blades. Combining the two files in Tecplot, we get the following image:\n Figure 5: Surface pressure contours on both blades   The pressure contours are nearly symmetrical in the opposite direction and consistent with what is expected of a rotating blade.\nThe behavior of the Mach Number provides proper insight into the aerodynamics of the flow field surrounding the rotor blade. Unlike pressure, it is not directly useful from an aeroacoustic point of view, but the implications in Aerodynamics are useful enough to study it in detail.\nConclusion The flow development around the tail rotor of the helicopter is mostly as expected, with a separation observed at the leading edge and a region of recirculation observed as the distance from the hub increases along the span of the blade. The observations made from the results can be summarized as follows:\n The oscillation in the solution is much lesser in the Turbulence Model. With an increase in y, the distance span-wise from the hub, the Mach Number as well as the flow separation increase, as expected. The difference in plots between the two cases is tangible, as the separation region is better defined with the turbulence model. This is because the S-A model specializes in solving boundary layers and adverse pressure gradients.

It focused on simulating the flow of supercritical Carbon Dioxide (CO2) through a small channel, studying the velocity and temperature profiles.\nIntroduction In the modern era of industrialization, many processes require the usage of solvents for different applications pertaining to the particular industry. For example, solvents are routinely used as paint removers, lacquers, adhesives, cleaning materials, etc. Different industries use different kinds of solvents for their own applications, and with an increase in health awareness, the food industry is looking to move away from classic solvents. Due to this, supercritical Carbon Dioxide is finding favor in the coffee manufacturing industry, as a decaffeinating solvent.\nIt is also gaining momentum in other industrial aspects, as a working fluid due to its relative stability, and as a component in power generation. Due to these advances and the growing use of Supercritical CO2, it is vital to study the characteristics and behavior of this fluid for innovative future applications.\nWhat is a supercritical fluid? A supercritical fluid is any fluid at a temperature and pressure above its critical point, where distinct liquid and gas phases do not exist. Applying temperature and pressure above the critical point of a substance, pushes that substance into the supercritical phase. The properties of this fluid can be adjusted by going further into the supercritical region. This is achieved by increasing the temperature or pressure.\n Figure 1: Depiction of various phases   Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Under normal atmospheric conditions, CO2 behaves as a gas, but if the temperature and the pressure are both increased to beyond the parameters of its critical point, it starts behaving midway between a liquid and a gas. This is called the supercritical state of CO2, with the fluid having a density similar to that of a liquid while occupying a volume in the same way a gas does. The parameters for the critical point for CO2 are given below:\nTemperature: 304.25 K Pressure: 7.39 MPa\nSimulation setup for normal CO2 In order to get familiarized with the behavior of CO2 in a flow channel, it was first simulated under normal conditions. The properties of CO2 were imported from NIST REFPROP, by writing a line of code in ANSYS Fluent to initialize the REFPROP database, and select the corresponding CO2 file to be imported.\nThe pipe length was set to be 0.1m, and the diameter as 0.005m. The boundary conditions are summarized below:\nInlet velocity = 0.5 m/s Temperature of Fluid at inlet = 300 K Wall Temperature = 273 K Outlet: Outflow Condition Walls: No-slip condition\nThe velocity and temperature profiles are plotted for the entire region, with analysis conducted on 9 sections across the length.\n Figure 2: Velocity profiles at each of the 9 slices   Therefore, we see that the velocity converges to parabolic throughout the course of the flow.\n Figure 3: Temperature profiles at each of the 9 slices   Therefore, we see that the temperature profile converges to parabolic.\nFrom the above data and analysis, we can conclude that flow of CO2 through a pipe develops, both hydrodynamically and thermally, after a certain point, as shown by the calculations. The next step is to simulate a similar case for supercritical flow, with the temperature and pressure being inputted accordingly.\nSimulation setup for supercritical CO2 The setup remains the same, except for the temperature of the fluid at the inlet, which is changed to 304.25 K, the supercritical temperature of CO2. However, at the supercritical pressure and temperature, the simulation in Fluent did not behave as expected, even if the outlet boundary condition is changed. So far, the NIST Real gas tables have been linked with the Fluent console. Since the results were not satisfactory, a different approach was required.\nNecessary properties such as density and thermal conductivity were explicitly exported from REFPROP into MS-Excel, and their variations with temperature were plotted. Using the trend line feature of Excel, the approximate polynomials for the respective graphs were extracted, as shown below:\n Figure 4: Physical properties as plotted in Excel   These polynomials are then inputted into Fluent as a new material, corresponding to CO2. When the User-Defined Function (UDF) was discarded, and the polynomials were inputted with the right units, there were no further errors in the initialization phase.\nThis simulation was run at an inlet velocity of 1m/s, keeping all the other boundary conditions the same. The velocity contour, however, was almost uniform, even though the flow was laminar. The same simulation was run at 0.01 m/s, and the velocity contour behaved as expected. Seeing this anomaly, the domain length was changed to 1m to see if there were any discernable changes in a larger flow domain. The velocity and temperature profiles are quite different, while the specific heat contours show a slight variation, and the pressure contours behave almost the same.\nConclusion Therefore, the variable material properties of supercritical carbon dioxide have successfully been imported into Fluent, utilizing the NIST provided REFPROP software. The polynomials generated through MS Excel have proved to be durable. The resulting velocity and temperature contours are deviant from the expected results and need to be probed into. Once this issue is resolved, the simulation can then be moved to a microchannel, with additional parameters like surface tension coming into play.\n","date":1597574083,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597574083,"objectID":"6136898d08b4f6aa89670215ae39c40f","permalink":"https://atsis98.github.io/project/kharagpur/","publishdate":"2020-08-16T16:04:43+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/kharagpur/","section":"project","summary":"The project focused on simulating the flow of supercritical Carbon Dioxide (CO2) through a small channel, studying the velocity and temperature profiles.","tags":["CFD","Supercritical Fluid"],"title":"Flow simulation of supercritical Carbon Dioxide through a channel","type":"project"},{"authors":["Harsha Sista"],"categories":["Undergraduate Projects"],"content":"The article chronicles a typical day during my internship at the National Aluminium Company, Mines and Refinery Complex, at Damanjodi.\nThe alarm rings. I reach to my side and turn it off. Somewhere, my subconscious self tells me to get up and wash those clothes lying in my bag, but my sleepy mind tunes it out and decides to wait for the next alarm by sleeping again.\n7:10 am – the dutiful alarm rings once again. I open my eyes, turn it off again, not realizing that it is the last of the three alarms I set. My eyes close, and when they open again, a sudden panic sets in on me, I turn to look at my phone, and see that it’s 7:35. I jolt awake, and drop my phone in the process. Perfect. I just hope it’s not broken. The moment of trepidation passes as I see that it\u0026rsquo;s safe. I scramble into the bathroom to brush and take a bath.\nSo, let me give you a little context as to why waking up at 7:35 is a disaster. My PS station is at National Aluminium Company, Refinery and Mines Complex, Damanjodi. The working hours are 8 to 5, six days a week, and the 17 of us from all three campuses of BITS are trainees for the summer.\n The entrance to the NALCO Plant   Let me tell you a little bit about the plant as well. Its primary purpose is to obtain alumina from the raw Bauxite, so that it can be sent to the other plant in Angul to obtain aluminium. So, the entire refinery uses various techniques to produce Alumina through a process called Bayer’s Process.\n A view of the Steam and Power Plant   So, coming back to today, I rushed to get ready by 8. Got there by 8:10, hurriedly woke my roommates and waited for them to get ready as well. By the time we got ready, called an auto and reached the gate, it was 9:20. After a little drama at the gate for being late, we went to have breakfast at the canteen and then went to our respective departments. I had been allotted the Steam and Power Plant (SPP), which served the double purpose of generating steam to be used in the process and generating electricity as a by-product. I went to meet my mentor, and he sat me down and explained how a boiler works. Since I have only completed my second year, I have a very limited knowledge of things that concern the plant, and whatever I’ve been learning here is almost entirely new.\nI listened to him with a combination of fascination and boredom, and when he had finished with the basic outline, he sent me to the boiler control room to visit the actual thing. A site engineer showed me around the place, explaining how things worked while showing me the different components and connections that worked perfectly in harmony to produce the desired results. I will not go into the technical details, partly because I don’t know them completely, but mostly because I wouldn’t want you getting bored by them.\nAfter the site visit, I went back to my mentor’s office. My days till now had mostly consisted of him teaching me things that I would learn in my third year, and their practical applications. I soon got used to the routine, and have begun to learn quite a few things, which I’m sure will help me in my studies.\nI went back around 11:30, and the two of us discussed how water was converted to steam and then superheated, through the boiler and its accessories. Although it sounds like a simple process, there is more to it than meets the eye. Every little detail has to be taken care of, every parameter scrutinized, if the entire apparatus has to function as per requirement.\nHe told me to study about boiler auxiliaries and mountings. Usually, he asks me to come back in the afternoon for another site visit, but today was different. He told me that without at least a basic knowledge of what’s going on in the system, a site visit would not be beneficial. He therefore let me go back to hostel at 1, telling me to come prepared tomorrow.\nI walked the 3 kilometres to the main gate, elated at the half-day and got into an auto that took me back to my hostel. Another day gone, where I learnt a little, experienced a new marvel of engineering, satisfied a little bit of my curiosity, and got an unexpected let off as well.\nA good day indeed.\n","date":1597487451,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598005851,"objectID":"3016839f94718bd818278ef745115dcd","permalink":"https://atsis98.github.io/post/ps1/","publishdate":"2020-08-15T16:00:51+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/ps1/","section":"post","summary":"The article chronicles a typical day during my internship at the National Aluminium Company, Mines and Refinery Complex, at Damanjodi.","tags":["PS-1","NALCO"],"title":"A day in the life of a NALCO intern","type":"post"}]
