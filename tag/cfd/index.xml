      <title>Aerodynamic Study of the flow field around the Tail Rotor and Fuselage of a Rotorcraft.</title>
      <link>https://atsis98.github.io/project/polimi-thesis/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was the focus of my undergraduate thesis at the Rotorcraft Aerodynamic Laboratory at Politecnico di Milano, under the guidance of Prof. Luigi Vigevano, Associate Professor at the Department of Aerospace Engineering. In this thesis, the aerodynamic study of the flow field around the tail rotor and fuselage of a rotorcraft is conducted by generating a high-resolution grid using ANSYS ICEM. Subsequent simulations are carried out on the in-house CFD solver, ROSITA, using the Navier-Stokes governing equation in combination with the Spallart-Allmaras Turbulence Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bintroductionb&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aerodynamics has always been at the cutting edge with respect to the development of aircraft and rotorcraft. With the development of computational methods and the resource to put them to use, aerodynamics has grown into something bigger and better. With today’s technology and tools, it is possible to analyze the flow past a stationary wing or a moving rotor and improve the design according to the requirements accordingly. Consequently, a lot of research has focused on this sector of the aerospace industry. With rotorcraft being more inherently complex aeromechanical vehicles, the understanding of the development of the flow field around them has lagged behind the traditional fixed-wing planes. Studying how the flow interacts and the noise it generates is garnering more attention as people are looking to increase the efficiency of future machines in terms of performance, as well as the generated sound. Therefore, gaining an understanding of noise generation and its relation to the aerodynamics of rotorcraft is of the utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bcontext-of-the-present-workb&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Context of the present work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific work undertaken during the course of this project is in the context of the work done by the European Action Group AG 24, ‘Helicopter Fuselage Scattering Effects for Exterior/Interior Noise Reduction’ in the Group for Aeronautical Research and Technology in Europe (GARTEUR). The objectives of this AG are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To develop and validate numerical prediction methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To generate a unique noise scattering database through wind tunnel tests using generic configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bobjectivesb&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objectives of my thesis were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grid generation around the tail rotor and the fuselage used by the Group for Aeronautical Research and Technology in Europe (GARTEUR) for the study of scattering by the helicopter fuselage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage of the in-house solver, Rotorcraft Solver Italy (ROSITA), to run aerodynamic simulations on the isolated tail rotor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the basics of aeroacoustics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running the simulation on the Rotor plus Fuselage Configuration on ROSITA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ban-insight-into-noiseb&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;An insight into Noise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noise can be generated from rotorcraft from a variety of sources, out of which the rotor, the engine, and the transmission, are the major sources. In the previous two decades, noise reduction has received industrial attention due to certification rules becoming more stringent. Due to industrial involvement, the development of prediction codes has taken a turn for the better. To meet the needs of the industry, the research into noise reduction has really taken off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noise is broadly classified into three categories, as shown in Figure 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loading and broadband noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blade-vortex noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thickness and high-speed impulsive noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A helicopter rotor is essentially an unsteady mechanism due to the velocity difference between the advancing and retreating sides. As shown in Figure 2, this creates different kinds of impacts and wakes, leading to noise generation.&lt;/p&gt;






  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-figure-2-a-schematic-of-the-aeromechanical-environment-of-a-helicopter-rotor&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://atsis98.github.io/project/polimi-thesis/featured_hufae70a7c83ace065abfe7f91d4a16909_114735_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;674&#34; height=&#34;407&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prediction codes are used to simulate the noise generated by helicopters and are divided into the following two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computational Aeroacoustics Approach (CAA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approach based on Integral formulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While CAA permits a combined aerodynamic and aeroacoustic study, it is very computationally intensive, since it is based on the classical field methods. On the other hand, Integral methods have a pre-requisite of the aerodynamic knowledge around the rotor but are more suitable for obtaining aeroacoustic data at any point in the given field. It is in the development of such integral methods that the current research trend has its focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bgeometry-and-meshingb&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geometry and meshing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geometry used by AG24 is that of a simple fuselage, with a tail boom and a tail rotor. Since the focus of this project was only on the tail rotor, only the relevant parts were extracted, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://atsis98.github.io/project/polimi-thesis/Fig.3_hu5be18ae7203f080ede98b2293bd41ce7_29327_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;400&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Figure 3: Blade and Hub assembly, with part of the drive shaft
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplification of the simulation process, the hub and the drive shaft of the assembly are neglected during calculations, and the resultant geometry is depicted below:&lt;/p&gt;






  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-figure-4-only-the-blades&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://atsis98.github.io/project/polimi-thesis/Fig.4_hu2ef0ed3b2f81acd20a1b5dffaafac1c7_6959_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;400&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Figure 4: Only the Blades
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-resolution grid around the rotor is required for the computation of the aerodynamics around the specified geometry for achieving a mesh independent simulation. During the solving process, the mesh should also be able to tag onto another background mesh if necessary. Due to the flexibility, it offers during meshing and the variety of options it provides for meshing complex and faceted geometries, ANSYS ICEM has been used as the meshing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bsimulation-setupb&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simulation setup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROtorcraft Software ITAly (ROSITA), version V 4.63, is the in-house solver that is used for this simulation during the course of this thesis. Its core element is a multi-block-structured steady, or unsteady solver with a second-order discretization scheme that supports overset grids. It supports the usage of the Chimera method, also known as the overset mesh technique, for meshing the domain. The overset method has multiple meshes with different geometrical complexities and tag them to a single overarching mesh. In this scenario, the surface mesh is tagged to the background mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methodology to be followed for running the simulation is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up parameters like the Governing Equations, Turbulence model, and time step in the configuration file, ROSITA.cfg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assigning the number of processors required for computation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Executing the code and running the post-processor after completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROSITA offers a variety of options for the solution: Solving the Euler equations, solving the Navier-Stokes equations without any turbulence model, and solving the RANS equations with a Spallart-Allmaras (S-A) turbulence model. To make a comparative study, the Blade Rotor simulation was run with two different setups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navier-Stokes equation without turbulence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navier-Stokes equation with Spallart-Allmaras turbulence model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bresult-extraction-on-tecolotb&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Result extraction on Tecolot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tecplot is a data visualization and post-processing software that is suitable for working with raw simulation data. Since the ROSITA post-processor outputs files in a Tecplot format, it is the natural choice for analyzing the results of the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of pressure over the surface of the blade is an interesting phenomenon that calls to be investigated. It is also important from an aeroacoustic point of view since many noise propagation codes, and studies use the pressure field in their calculations. Therefore, obtaining a proper pressure distribution is essential, and a comparison to see which model yields the better results is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ROSITA Solver generates two surface files in the .plt format, with data for each of the two blades. Combining the two files in Tecplot, we get the following image:&lt;/p&gt;






  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-figure-5-surface-pressure-contours-on-both-blades&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://atsis98.github.io/project/polimi-thesis/Fig.5_hubed5b54afa66e2327a57c91e6472468d_17528_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Figure 5: Surface pressure contours on both blades
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure contours are nearly symmetrical in the opposite direction and consistent with what is expected of a rotating blade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior of the Mach Number provides proper insight into the aerodynamics of the flow field surrounding the rotor blade. Unlike pressure, it is not directly useful from an aeroacoustic point of view, but the implications in Aerodynamics are useful enough to study it in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bconclusionb&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flow development around the tail rotor of the helicopter is mostly as expected, with a separation observed at the leading edge and a region of recirculation observed as the distance from the hub increases along the span of the blade. The observations made from the results can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The oscillation in the solution is much lesser in the Turbulence Model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With an increase in y, the distance span-wise from the hub, the Mach Number as well as the flow separation increase, as expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference in plots between the two cases is tangible, as the separation region is better defined with the turbulence model. This is because the S-A model specializes in solving boundary layers and adverse pressure gradients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Flow simulation of supercritical Carbon Dioxide through a channel</title>
      <link>https://atsis98.github.io/project/kharagpur/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2020 16:04:43 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://atsis98.github.io/project/kharagpur/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was the focus of my research-oriented summer internship under Dr. Sourav Mitra, Assistant Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. It focused on simulating the flow of supercritical Carbon Dioxide (CO2) through a small channel, studying the velocity and temperature profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bintroductionb&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the modern era of industrialization, many processes require the usage of solvents for different applications pertaining to the particular industry. For example, solvents are routinely used as paint removers, lacquers, adhesives, cleaning materials, etc. Different industries use different kinds of solvents for their own applications, and with an increase in health awareness, the food industry is looking to move away from classic solvents. Due to this, supercritical Carbon Dioxide is finding favor in the coffee manufacturing industry, as a decaffeinating solvent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also gaining momentum in other industrial aspects, as a working fluid due to its relative stability, and as a component in power generation. Due to these advances and the growing use of Supercritical CO2, it is vital to study the characteristics and behavior of this fluid for innovative future applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bwhat-is-a-supercritical-fluidb&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is a supercritical fluid?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A supercritical fluid is any fluid at a temperature and pressure above its critical point, where distinct liquid and gas phases do not exist. Applying temperature and pressure above the critical point of a substance, pushes that substance into the supercritical phase. The properties of this fluid can be adjusted by going further into the supercritical region.  This is achieved by increasing the temperature or pressure.&lt;/p&gt;






  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-figure-1-depiction-of-various-phases&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://atsis98.github.io/project/kharagpur/featured_hu6a5ba817c1370bba59b9bd21c40945ab_7869_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Figure 1: Depiction of various phases
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bsupercritical-carbon-dioxideb&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supercritical Carbon Dioxide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under normal atmospheric conditions, CO2 behaves as a gas, but if the temperature and the pressure are both increased to beyond the parameters of its critical point, it starts behaving midway between a liquid and a gas. This is called the supercritical state of CO2, with the fluid having a density similar to that of a liquid while occupying a volume in the same way a gas does. The parameters for the critical point for CO2 are given below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperature: 304.25 K
Pressure: 7.39 MPa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bsimulation-setup-for-normal-co2b&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simulation setup for normal CO2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get familiarized with the behavior of CO2 in a flow channel, it was first simulated under normal conditions. The properties of CO2 were imported from NIST REFPROP, by writing a line of code in ANSYS Fluent to initialize the REFPROP database, and select the corresponding CO2 file to be imported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipe length was set to be 0.1m, and the diameter as 0.005m. The boundary conditions are summarized below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inlet velocity = 0.5 m/s
Temperature of Fluid at inlet = 300 K
Wall Temperature = 273 K
Outlet: Outflow Condition
Walls: No-slip condition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The velocity and temperature profiles are plotted for the entire region, with analysis conducted on 9 sections across the length.&lt;/p&gt;






  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-figure-2-velocity-profiles-at-each-of-the-9-slices&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://atsis98.github.io/project/kharagpur/fig1_hu7c4308242bdac15171d0d224bea94f38_45979_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Figure 2: Velocity profiles at each of the 9 slices
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we see that the velocity converges to parabolic throughout the course of the flow.&lt;/p&gt;






  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-figure-3-temperature-profiles-at-each-of-the-9-slices&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://atsis98.github.io/project/kharagpur/fig2_hu95052270e72abb6f0f78e30d5963d6ec_47501_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Figure 3: Temperature profiles at each of the 9 slices
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we see that the temperature profile converges to parabolic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above data and analysis, we can conclude that flow of CO2 through a pipe develops, both hydrodynamically and thermally, after a certain point, as shown by the calculations. The next step is to simulate a similar case for supercritical flow, with the temperature and pressure being inputted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bsimulation-setup-for-supercritical-co2b&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simulation setup for supercritical CO2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup remains the same, except for the temperature of the fluid at the inlet, which is changed to 304.25 K, the supercritical temperature of CO2. However, at the supercritical pressure and temperature, the simulation in Fluent did not behave as expected, even if the outlet boundary condition is changed. So far, the NIST Real gas tables have been linked with the Fluent console. Since the results were not satisfactory, a different approach was required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necessary properties such as density and thermal conductivity were explicitly exported from REFPROP into MS-Excel, and their variations with temperature were plotted. Using the trend line feature of Excel, the approximate polynomials for the respective graphs were extracted, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;






  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-figure-4-physical-properties-as-plotted-in-excel&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://atsis98.github.io/project/kharagpur/fig3_hudb3164edf7eb247aaf7b06ff45def06f_70741_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; height=&#34;750&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Figure 4: Physical properties as plotted in Excel
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These polynomials are then inputted into Fluent as a new material, corresponding to CO2. When the User-Defined Function (UDF) was discarded, and the polynomials were inputted with the right units, there were no further errors in the initialization phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simulation was run at an inlet velocity of 1m/s, keeping all the other boundary conditions the same. The velocity contour, however, was almost uniform, even though the flow was laminar. The same simulation was run at 0.01 m/s, and the velocity contour behaved as expected. Seeing this anomaly, the domain length was changed to 1m to see if there were any discernable changes in a larger flow domain. The velocity and temperature profiles are quite different, while the specific heat contours show a slight variation, and the pressure contours behave almost the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bconclusionb&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the variable material properties of supercritical carbon dioxide have successfully been imported into Fluent, utilizing the NIST provided REFPROP software. The polynomials generated through MS Excel have proved to be durable. The resulting velocity and temperature contours are deviant from the expected results and need to be probed into. Once this issue is resolved, the simulation can then be moved to a microchannel, with additional parameters like surface tension coming into play.&lt;/p&gt;
